# poweradmin_exporter
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FXinnovation/poweradmin_exporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FXinnovation/poweradmin_exporter)


PowerAdmin exporter for Prometheus.

Export metrics from PA - PowerAdmin (https://www.poweradmin.com/) monitoring solution using the Power Admin API.
It takes the status of the monitors and exposes them as an exporter. The status is exposed and mapped to a table which is dynamic.
### Features
- Uses the PA API to fetch monitor values
- You can map the monitor status to a number in a file
- Transform names of monitors so that it's compliant with prometheus
### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need a [working Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Installing

```bash
go get -u github.com/FXinnovation/poweradmin_exporter
```

## Running the tests

```bash
make test
```

## Usage

```bash
./poweradmin_exporter -h
```

## Deployment

The exporter listens on port 9575 by default, which can be changed if you need.
[This port is the default port for this exporter.](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/Default-port-allocations)

### Exporter configuration
The configuration is by default under the *config* folder. The *--config.dir* command line option lets the possibility to override this value.

All the files placed in this folder are parsed whatever their names, but must be YAML files.
The config files can contain the following items
```
server: "https://paserver"
api_key: "THE_API_KEY"
skip_tls_verify: false
database: "server=localhost;Database=PA_DB;Schema=dbo;user id=sa;password=secret123;"
group: ## a list of group names to monitor
  - name: "Dev"
    servers:
      - "Server"
  - name: "MyWonderfulMachines"
```
The _skip_tls_verify_ option gives you the possibility to skip the certificate checking for self signed certs for example.
### Status mapping for monitors
PowerAdmin API uses the following values for the status of the monitors.

Status|Value in GET_MONITOR_INFO call
------|-----
Alert|2
Alert - Skipping Actions|10
Alert - Green|17
Alert - Red|18
Alert - Suppressing|19
Bad License|14
Can't Run|4
Dependency Not Met|16
Disabled|6
Error|3
Error - Suppressed|21
OK|1
OK - Unacknowledged Alerts - Yellow|20
OK - Unacknowledged Alerts - Red|24
OK - Unacknowledged Alerts - Green|25
Monitor Busy|11
Monitor Maintenance Mode|13
Satellite Disconnected|23
Scheduled|7
Server Disabled|22
Server Maintenance Mode|26
Startup Pause|8
Training|12
Unlicensed|9
 	

The _status_mapping.yml_ file contains the values as float64 returned in the metrics for each string status returned by PowerAdmin. You can also specify a default value.
```
statusMapping:
  values:
    "ok": 1
  default: 0

```


## Building
Build the sources with 
```bash
make build
```
**Note**: As this is a go build you can use _GOOS_ and _GOARCH_ environment variables to build for another platform.
### Crossbuilding
The _Makefile_ contains a _crossbuild_ target which builds all the platforms defined in _.promu.yml_ file and puts the files in _.build_ folder. Alternatively you can specify one platform to build with the OSARCH environment variable;
```bash
OSARCH=linux/amd64 make crossbuild
```
## Docker image

You can build a docker image using:
```bash
make docker
```
The resulting image is named `fxinnovation/poweradmin_exporter:{git-branch}`.
It exposes port 9575 and expects the config files to be in */config* folder including the _status_mapping_ file. To configure it, you can bind-mount a config from your host: 
```
$ docker run -p 9575 -v /path/on/host/config:/config fxinnovation/poweradmin_exporter:master
```
